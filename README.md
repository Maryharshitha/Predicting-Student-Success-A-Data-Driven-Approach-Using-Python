Project Overview: This report presents an analytics study focused on understanding key factors contributing to student success and retention using real-life data from an anonymous institute. We leveraged Python for data analysis, performed various statistical models, and visualized the findings using relevant graphs and charts. Regression models were used to identify patterns in the data and make predictions about student performance, including their likelihood of passing the first term and continuing enrollment in subsequent terms.

The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into student behaviors and factors that influence their success in the first term. By identifying these patterns, we can better support students through targeted interventions and improve overall retention rates.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for identifying trends and relationships
Regression modeling to predict outcomes (e.g., student pass/fail, retention)
Data visualization to communicate insights effectively through graphs and charts
The findings from this study aim to support decision-making processes that help enhance the academic experience, retention strategies, and overall student success at the institute.# Predicting-Student-Success-A-Data-Driven-Approach-Using-Python
